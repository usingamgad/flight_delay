2) Interaction between Shiny and a Python script.

3) Python script that predicts the delay (multi class classification)

4) Jupyter notebook (Python) to analyse the flight delay data and save the final classification model to be used by Shiny app.

# Use

Input your flight details (Date, Time, Origin, Destination and Airline) and press Classify button to predict

Use the Python notebook to develop any other models
